# MonsterFighter-Game
Here is my game made for a university group project. The game is built on JAVA 17.
The requirements for the project were to build a battle game that progressed over multiple days.


## Install Instructions
The game runs on JAVA 17 and can be installed from [releases](https://github.com/blueberrypi-studio/MonsterFighter-Game/releases/tag/V1.0). It is run as a .jar file.

## How to Play

in addition to the above help screen, the game will end after the user specified number of days, with each day progressing after the player sleeps

## Battles
The battles in the game function in a similar style to Pokemon, each monster has its own type, and each type is more effective against another type, and weak to another type. These type differences can be figured out logically, i.e fire vs water, as seen in the image below.
